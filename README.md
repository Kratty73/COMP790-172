## About The Project

The application consists of 6 visible components
* Ball
* Target
* Splashes
* Force Meter
* Pointer
* Score Board

Every time the user opens the application, the scoreboard displays the highscore previously recorded, the user is tasked to beat the score or achieve the perfect score in 5 tries given.
Every try consists of user input to set the target, once the target is set, the pointer moves along the force-meter allowing the user to adjust the force with which they decide to hit the ball with.
Once the user provides another input, the ball is thrown at an angle of 45 degree upwards to the user's desired trajectory and with the force user provided.
If the ball hits the target within 3 seconds of the throw, the user is provided some score correspoding to the point-of-contact. Else the user is awarded 0 points for that throw

The application should be considered a game
Here's why:
* The application provides the user with a goal to be achieved.
* The application components are interactive, as in the application interacts with the user inputs (eg: the sound generated when the ball hits the target, the force meter etc.)
* The application components are synthetic compared to a real world setting, (eg: ball, target, splash etc.)
